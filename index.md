<h1> Hello World</h1>

<p>Pardon the construction dot gif from 1995 :)</p>

<p>Please excuse the mess. I'm building out this page. In the meantime, feel free to click on all these links.</p>

<h1>Content I'm Making</h1>
<h2>I'm not a professional video, audio, or image editor. However, I've created or helped create bunch of content for the internet for a long time. Since the pandemic, I've started to try different mediums for content creation. Below are some links to video and audio content I'm currently putting out weekly.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamgautsch" title="Some people call me the Casey Neistat of LinkedIn. No one calls me that">I share most of the short-form video content I create first on LinkedIn. Give me a follow there to, well, follow along.</li>
<li><a href="http://aflyonthecall.com/" title="Link to Anchor landing page">I do a weekly podcast with fellow ATDC startup catalyst Monique Mills. We call it 'A Fly On The Call'.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ATDCVideos" title="No one calls me the Casey Neistat of YouTube.">Most of the longer video content I create is on the ATDC YouTube channel. I try to post there are least every Tuesday and Thursday. Give it watch and a follow. Some of the content might not be mine, but it will all be startup focused.</a></li></ul>
